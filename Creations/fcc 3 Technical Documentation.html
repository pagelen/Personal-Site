        <p>
          Iceland is a Nordic island country between the North Atlantic and
          Arctic Oceans, on the <code>Mid-Atlantic Ridge</code> between North
          America and Europe. It is linked culturally and politically with
          Europe, and is the region's most sparsely populated country. Its
          capital and largest city is Reykjavík, which is home to about 36% of
          the country's roughly 380,000 residents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The official language of the country is Icelandic. Located on a rift
          between tectonic plates, Iceland's geologic activity includes geysers
          and frequent volcanic eruptions.

        <p>
          The Faroe or Faeroe Islands are an archipelago in the North Atlantic
          Ocean and an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. The
          official language of the country is <code>Faroese</code> , which is
          closely related to and partially mutually intelligible with Icelandic.
          The capital and largest city, Tórshavn, receives the fewest hours of
          sunshine of any city in the world at a mere 840 per year.

          While archaeological evidence points to earlier human habitation,
          <code>Færeyinga Saga</code> and the writings of Dicuil place initial
          Norse settlement in the early 9th century.
